This software was suggested by Julien Delange and was realised by two
EPITA students, Julio Guerra and Patrick Samy.

MSC is a graphical and textual language for the description and
specification of the interactions between system components. The main
area of application for Message Sequence Charts is as an overview
specification of the communication behaviour of real-time systems, in
particular telecommunication switching systems. Message Sequence
Charts may be used for requirement specification, simulation and
validation, test-case specification and documentation of real-time
systems. MSCs are often used in combination with SDL, in particular
the ITU specification and description language.
