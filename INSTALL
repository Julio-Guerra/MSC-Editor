* Step 1: Create directory build/ cd <tarball directory> && mkdir
build && cd build

* Step 2: Generate CMake files cmake ..

If you need to compile the project in Debug mode, use instead: cmake
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

CMake will exit printing an error message if you do not have every
packages needed. Install it, and restart the process.

* Step 3: Compile
make

* Step 4: run the binary msce located in the build directory
./msce

In case of problems, it probably comes from retro compatibility
errors. We used the following settings:
* C++ Standard : C++03.
* CMake 2.8.3.
* Antlr 3.3.
