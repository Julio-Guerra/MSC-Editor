* Replace msc/types.hh pointers typedefs with "garbage collected"
  pointers, and make it transparent enough with normal pointers to be
  able to write as if it was normal pointers. e.g. cast into bool (if
  (ptr)), operator= (ptr = new_ptr) with a pointer, comparison
  operators (shared_ptr == normal_ptr), etc.

* Complete the AST. Only a subset has been considered. The MSC
  language is much more rich than what we offer right now.

* Detect if the input is MSC96 or MSC2000. For now, it is MSC96 by
  default.

* Finish the Qt front-end.

* Implement other front-ends (visio, etc.).

* Test to compile the project on Windows...

* Add a CMake option to choose which front-end to compile. By default,
  compile every thing.
