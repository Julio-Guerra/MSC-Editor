4th of June, 2011:
Todo, order by priority desc:

1 Complete the AST. Only a subset has been considered. The MSC
  language is much more rich than what we offer right now.

2 Finish the Qt front-end.

3 Replace msc/types.hh pointers typedefs with "garbage collected"
  pointers, and make it transparent enough with normal pointers to be
  able to write as if it was normal pointers. e.g. cast into bool (if
  (ptr)), operator= (ptr = new_ptr) with a pointer, comparison
  operators (shared_ptr == normal_ptr), etc.

4 Handle parsing errors in the Front-End. For now, it prints on cout.

5 Implement new front-ends (visio, etc.).

6 Add a CMake option to choose which front-end to compile. By default,
  compile every thing.

7 Make the grammar context free and use Bison instead of ANTLR.

8 Test to compile the project on Windows...

9 Find out how to reset antlr parser without freeing everything and
  start again.
